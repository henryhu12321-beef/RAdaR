## 📝 Abstract
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in complex reasoning tasks but are often constrained by the issue of overthinking and underthinking, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Existing adaptive reasoning approaches face critical challenges, including data scarcity, catastrophic forgetting, and sensitivity to prompts. To address these limitations, we propose AdaR, an RL-native framework for adaptive reasoning with a two-stage training process: In Stage I, the model is trained to produce outputs that follow the prescribed formats of the two reasoning modes, Thinking and Instant, using a curriculum-style formatting strategy. In Stage II, we model adaptive reasoning as a reasoning mode selection problem and train the model to dynamically choose appropriate strategies for each input by predicting the corresponding mode-control start token. In addition, we introduce a capability-aware data construction pipeline that provides highly discriminative supervision for adaptive reasoning in VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that RAdaR achieves a significant reduction in reasoning overhead while improving accuracy by up to 7.6% over the base model and 14.7% over SOTA methods, respectively. To ensure reproducibility and promote further research, we will release the code, datasets, and model weights.

## 🚀 Getting Started

## 🔧 0. Before You Start
### System Requirements

| Component | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| OS | Linux (Ubuntu recommended) |
| Python | 3.12 |
| CUDA Toolkit | 12.x (nvcc required for compiling flash-attn, etc.) |
| CUDA Driver | ≥ 550.x |
| GPU | NVIDIA A800/A100/H100 (80GB recommended) |
| PyTorch | 2.8.0+cu128 |

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
cd RAdaR
```

2. Create a conda environment and install dependencies:
```bash
# 1. Create conda environment
conda create -n RAdaR python=3.12 -y
conda activate RAdaR

# 2. Install PyTorch with CUDA 12.8 support (MUST install first)
pip install torch==2.8.0 torchvision==0.23.0 torchaudio==2.8.0

# 3. Install core dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Set CUDA_HOME and install packages that require CUDA compilation
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda  # adjust to your CUDA 12.x path
pip install -r requirements-special.txt --no-build-isolation

# 5. (Optional) Install dev tools
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# 6. (Optional) If you need latex2sympy2 for evaluation:
pip install -e evaluation/latex2sympy
```
### Prepare
#### 1. Download training dataset
```bash
pip install huggingface_hub

huggingface-cli download --repo-type dataset hengrui1234/RADAR_IMAGES --local-dir ./radar_images
```

#### 2. Modify image dir
You need to change the data path in the code to your actual local storage path.

Please modify the `custom_image_dir = "/PATH/TO/YOUR/RADAR_IMAGES" `in the following scripts:

`examples/vlm/radar_stage1_1_train.py`

`examples/vlm/radar_stage1_2_train.py`

`examples/vlm/radar_stage2_train.py`


##### 3. Download checkpoint
https://huggingface.co/hengrui1234/RAdaR
```bash
huggingface-cli download Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct --local-dir ./qwen3vl_7b
huggingface-cli download --repo-type dataset hengrui1234/RAdaR --local-dir ./radar_checkpoint
```
#### 4. Modify checkpoint dir
You need to change the checkpoint path in the code to your actual local storage path.

Please modify the `path: <YOUR_LOCAL_PATH_TO_Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct> ` in `examples/vlm/radar_gspo_stage1_1_bs32_rollout32.yaml`

Please modify the `path: <YOUR_LOCAL_PATH_TO_STAGE1_1_CHECKPOINT> ` in `examples/vlm/radar_gspo_stage1_2_bs32_rollout32.yaml`

Please modify the `path: <YOUR_LOCAL_PATH_TO_STAGE1_2_CHECKPOINT> ` in `examples/vlm/radar_gspo_stage2_bs32_rollout32.yaml`
